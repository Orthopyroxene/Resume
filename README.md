# Welcome to My Repo!

Hello! I'm Andrew, a passionate individual with a background in Applied Geology and Geospatial Intelligence. I am currently expanding my knowledge in Information Technology (Programming) at Tafe full-time. This repository serves as a hub for sharing my work, professional and academic.

# Projects from my Post Graduate Studies

## Gold Prospecting in Western Australia - Interactive Web Application

Explore the rich geological history of Western Australia through an interactive web application designed to assist prospectors and enthusiasts alike in discovering potential gold prospecting sites. This tool integrates geological, environmental, and structural data to identify promising areas for exploration.

- **Prospecting Application:** [Gold Prospecting in WA](http://157.245.201.158/~Barley/webapp/Index.html)
  - Navigate through various interactive maps and resources designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the terrain, including key locations and geological insights.

## Remote Sensing Report Summary - Mesquite Invasion in Pilbara

I conducted a detailed study on the invasive spread of Mesquite in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The report titled "Mesquite Invasion in the Pilbara, Western Australia" utilized advanced remote sensing techniques to analyze the distribution and control measures over time.

### Key Points of the Study
- **Objective:** To assess the effectiveness of various control methods used over the decades and recommend strategies for future management using remote sensing data.
- **Methods:** Employed satellite imaging from different years (1988, 1998, 2008, 2018, and 2023) and applied change detection methods like image differencing, change vector analysis, and multidate change classification.
- **Findings:** Identified the dynamic spread of Mesquite, its impact on the local ecosystem, and evaluated the success of biological control measures introduced in 1998.
- **Conclusion:** Provided insights into which control methods were most effective and proposed recommendations for ongoing management strategies to curb the proliferation of this invasive species.

This research not only highlighted the persistent challenge of managing Mesquite in arid environments but also demonstrated the power of remote sensing in ecological management and planning.

# Personal Projects

## Dungeons and Dragons Web Mapping Application

As part of my ongoing projects in QGIS, I am developing a unique web mapping application tailored for Dungeons and Dragons enthusiasts. This application allows users to create detailed, interactive maps based on real-world suburb data, enabling them to design and manage campaigns with geographic precision, for more information [click here](https://github.com/Orthopyroxene/Fantasy-Maps-with-QGIS/blob/main/README.md).

### Project Overview
- **Objective:** To integrate real-world geography into D&D campaigns by transforming suburb maps into fantasy settings. 
- **Tools Used:** QGIS for map creation and processing, integrated into a web platform for interactive user engagement. Maps created using Inkarnate. 
- **Current Status:** In development, with several prototype maps already created. 

### Sample Maps
Below are some examples of the progress I've made with maps of Glen Forrest, showcasing both a grid overlay for gameplay and a poster-style map for storytelling:

*Figure 2: Poster map of Glen Forrest.*

These maps are in the early stages of development. I am working on player interactivity by allowing users to seamlessly transition between large-scale suburb maps and detailed maps of landmarks and buildings. This feature aims to enrich the Dungeons & Dragons experience by anchoring fantasy adventures in real-world locations, thereby creating a link between fantasy and reality for the players.
