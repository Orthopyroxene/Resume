# Welcome to My Repo!

Hello! I'm Andrew, a passionate individual with a background in Applied Geology and Geospatial Intelligence. I am currently expanding my knowledge in Information Technology (Programming). This repository serves as a hub for sharing my work, insights, and valuable resources related to gold prospecting in Western Australia, as well as my contributions to the field of geochemical visualization and exploration technologies.

## Gold Prospecting in Western Australia - Interactive Web Application

Explore the rich geological history of Western Australia through an interactive web application designed to assist prospectors and enthusiasts alike in discovering potential gold prospecting sites. This tool integrates geological, environmental, and structural data to identify promising areas for exploration.

- **Main Web Application:** [Gold Prospecting in WA](http://157.245.201.158/~Barley/webapp/Index.html)
  
- Navigate through various interactive maps and resources designed to provide an in-depth understanding of the terrain, including key locations and geological insights.
